# Console.log Consolidation & Logging System

**Status**: Doing
**Priority**: A (Critical)
**Estimated Effort**: 3 story points (1-2 weeks)
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Create a centralized logging package for the TeamHub monorepo to replace scattered console.log statements with a unified, configurable logging system. This package will provide structured logging, log levels, and centralized log management across all applications and packages.

## Business Value

- **Debugging Efficiency**: Centralized log management for faster issue resolution
- **Production Monitoring**: Structured logs for production debugging and monitoring
- **Development Experience**: Consistent logging patterns across the entire codebase
- **Maintenance**: Easier log filtering, formatting, and management
- **Compliance**: Structured logging for audit trails and compliance requirements

## Requirements

### Logging System Features

- **Log Levels**: Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Trace with configurable verbosity
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with metadata and context
- **Log Categories**: Application, module, and feature-based log categorization
- **Environment Awareness**: Different log levels and formats for dev/staging/prod
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead with async logging capabilities
- **Integration**: Easy integration with existing console.log statements

### Package Structure

- **Core Logger**: Main logging interface with level-based filtering
- **Formatters**: Multiple output formats (JSON, human-readable, structured)
- **Transporters**: Console, file, and remote logging capabilities
- **Middleware**: Request/response logging, performance monitoring
- **Utilities**: Log parsing, filtering, and analysis tools

### Technical Requirements

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support
- **Monorepo Integration**: Proper package configuration for all applications
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on application performance
- **Flexibility**: Easy to configure and extend for different use cases
- **Backward Compatibility**: Gradual migration from console.log

### Core Logger Implementation

- **Logger Class**: Main interface with level-based methods
- **Context Management**: Request ID, user ID, organization ID tracking
- **Performance Monitoring**: Execution time and resource usage logging
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error recovery
- **Configuration**: Environment-based settings and customization

### Migration Strategy

- **Phase 1**: Create logging package and basic functionality
- **Phase 2**: Implement in one application as proof of concept
- **Phase 3**: Gradual migration across all applications
- **Phase 4**: Remove console.log statements and enforce logging standards

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete logging package with all required features
- [ ] TypeScript definitions and proper type safety
- [ ] Integration examples for all applications in the monorepo
- [ ] Migration guide from console.log to new logging system
- [ ] Unit tests for all logging functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarks showing minimal overhead
- [ ] Documentation with usage examples and best practices
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration examples

## Success Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: 100% of console.log statements replaced
- **Performance Impact**: <5ms overhead for typical logging operations
- **Developer Adoption**: Easy integration and consistent usage patterns
- **Log Quality**: Structured, searchable logs for production debugging
- **Maintenance**: Reduced time spent on log-related issues

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1

- [ ] Design logging system architecture
- [ ] Create core logger with basic functionality
- [ ] Implement formatters and transporters
- [ ] Add TypeScript types and interfaces

### Week 2

- [ ] Create integration examples
- [ ] Implement middleware for request/response logging
- [ ] Add performance monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests

### Week 3

- [ ] Create migration guide and documentation
- [ ] Implement in one application as proof of concept
- [ ] Performance optimization and testing
- [ ] Package distribution and integration

## Notes

- Consider integration with existing monitoring tools (Sentry, etc.)
- Ensure logging doesn't expose sensitive information
- Plan for log retention and storage policies
- Consider real-time log streaming for development
