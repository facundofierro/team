   - Support multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile)
   - Provide easy setup instructions

3. **Network Access**

   - Access to TeamHub server (development/staging)
   - Access to internal databases and services
   - Access to MCP containers and resources
   - Access to internal monitoring and logging

4. **Security & Management**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Connection logging and monitoring
   - IP address management and restrictions
   - Automatic connection management

### Technical Requirements

1. **VPN Protocol**: WireGuard (preferred) or OpenVPN
2. **Authentication**: Integration with existing TeamHub auth system
3. **Network**: Support for both IPv4 and IPv6
4. **Performance**: Minimal latency impact on development workflow
5. **Reliability**: Automatic reconnection and failover

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Days 1-2)

   - Choose VPN solution (WireGuard recommended)
   - Deploy on TeamHub infrastructure
   - Configure network interfaces and routing

2. **Network Configuration**
   - Set up internal network access rules
   - Configure DNS resolution for internal services
   - Test connectivity to key resources

### Phase 2: Authentication & Management (Days 3-4)

1. **User Management**

   - Integrate with TeamHub user system
   - Create VPN user accounts and permissions
   - Set up client certificate management

2. **Client Configuration**
   - Generate client configuration files
   - Create platform-specific setup guides
   - Test on different operating systems

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (Day 5)

1. **Testing**

   - Test VPN connectivity from external networks
   - Verify access to all required internal resources
   - Performance testing and optimization

2. **Documentation**
   - Create setup and usage documentation
   - Document troubleshooting procedures
   - Create maintenance and monitoring guides

## Technical Architecture

### VPN Server Components

```
Internet → Load Balancer → VPN Server → Internal Network
                ↓
            Authentication
            (TeamHub Auth)
```

### Network Topology

```
VPN Clients → VPN Server (10.0.1.1) → Internal Network (10.0.0.0/16)
                ↓
            TeamHub Server (10.0.0.10)
            MCP Containers (10.0.0.20-30)
            Databases (10.0.0.40-50)
```

## Dependencies

- **Infrastructure**: Access to TeamHub server infrastructure
- **Network**: Internal network configuration and routing
- **Authentication**: TeamHub user management system
- **Documentation**: Network topology and service locations

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ **VPN Server Operational**

   - VPN server running and accessible
   - Authentication system integrated
   - Network routing configured correctly

2. ✅ **Client Access Working**

   - Team members can connect from external networks
   - Access to TeamHub server and services
   - Stable and reliable connections

3. ✅ **Documentation Complete**

   - Setup guides for all platforms
   - Troubleshooting documentation
   - Maintenance procedures documented

4. ✅ **Security Verified**
   - Authentication working correctly
   - Network access properly restricted
   - Logging and monitoring active

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Network Security**: VPN access to internal network
- **Authentication**: Secure user access management

### Medium Risk

- **Performance**: VPN impact on development workflow
- **Reliability**: Connection stability and uptime

### Low Risk

- **Platform Support**: Client compatibility issues
- **Documentation**: Setup complexity for team members

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Security**: Implement strict access controls and monitoring
2. **Performance**: Use WireGuard for minimal overhead
3. **Reliability**: Set up monitoring and automatic failover
4. **Usability**: Provide clear documentation and support

## Future Enhancements

1. **Mobile Support**: Optimize for mobile VPN clients
2. **Advanced Routing**: Route-specific traffic through VPN
3. **Load Balancing**: Multiple VPN servers for redundancy
4. **Integration**: VPN status in TeamHub dashboard

## Notes

- Consider using WireGuard for better performance and security
- Integrate with existing TeamHub monitoring and alerting
- Plan for team growth and additional VPN users
- Document network topology for future reference
