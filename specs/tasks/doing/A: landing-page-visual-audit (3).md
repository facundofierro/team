# Landing Page Visual Audit & Comparison

**Status**: Doing
**Priority**: A (Critical)
**Estimated Effort**: 3 story points (1 week)
**Dependencies**: Landing page refactoring and colors implementation completion

## Description

Perform a comprehensive visual audit and comparison between the current landing page and the reference design using Playwright MCP. Identify visual differences, missing elements, and areas that need adjustment to match the reference design exactly.

## Business Value

- **Design Accuracy**: Ensure landing page matches reference design precisely
- **Quality Assurance**: Identify and fix visual inconsistencies
- **User Experience**: Maintain consistent visual experience across all sections
- **Brand Consistency**: Align with reference design standards

## Reference URLs

**Current Landing Page**: http://localhost:3003
**Reference Design**: https://designs.magicpath.ai/v1/lucky-cloud-5966

## Implementation Plan

**SCOPE LIMITATION**: This audit focuses **ONLY** on the first load/above-the-fold content visible without scrolling. We will not analyze content that requires scrolling to view.

### Step 1: Initial Visual Comparison (Above-the-Fold Only)

- [ ] **Take viewport screenshots (no scrolling)**

  - [ ] Ensure screenshots capture only what's visible on first load

- [ ] **Compare above-the-fold structure**
  - [ ] Identify sections visible in first load of reference design
  - [ ] Compare section order and layout in viewport
  - [ ] Note any missing sections in current implementation (above-the-fold only)
