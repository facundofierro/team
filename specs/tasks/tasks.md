## File Naming Convention

Tasks use the format: `{Priority}: {task-name} ({story-points})`

**Story Points Scale:**

- **1**: Very small task (1-2 days)
- **2**: Small task (3-5 days)
- **3**: Medium task (1-2 weeks)
- **4**: Large task (2-3 weeks)
- **5**: Very large task (3-4 weeks)

**Examples:**

- `A: mcp-tools (3)` - Priority A, medium complexity
- `B: public-agents (5)` - Priority B, very large complexity
- `C: analytics-public-agents (4)` - Priority C, large complexity
