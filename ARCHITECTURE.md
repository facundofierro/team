# TeamHub Architecture & Deployment Guide

## High-Level Architecture

TeamHub is a multi-tenant AI agent management platform built with a modular, scalable architecture. Each organization operates in an isolated environment with its own database, agents, and settings.

### Main Components

- **Frontend/Backend:** Next.js (App Router)
- **UI:** shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** Neon (Postgres, one per organization)
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication:** next-auth
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Monitoring:** Sentry

## Data Flow & Multi-Tenancy

- Each organization is provisioned a dedicated Postgres database on Neon.
- All agent data, insights, and settings are stored per-organization.
- API routes and server actions enforce organization isolation and security.
- Users can switch organizations via the UI; all queries and mutations are scoped to the selected organization.

## UI/UX

- All UI is built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components for accessibility and consistency.
- Sidebar navigation allows switching between organizations, agents, insights, and settings.
- Dialogs and forms use shadcn/ui primitives for a modern, responsive experience.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Vercel account (for hosting Next.js app)
- Neon account (for Postgres databases)
- Required environment variables (see README)

### Steps

1. **Provision Neon Project:**
   - Create a Neon project and note your API key and project ID.
   - The app will automatically provision a new database for each organization.
2. **Configure Vercel Project:**
   - Deploy the Next.js app to Vercel.
   - Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard (`NEON_API_KEY`, `NEON_PROJECT_ID`, etc.).
3. **Connect Domains (Optional):**
   - Add custom domains in Vercel for production.
4. **Monitor & Scale:**
   - Use Sentry for error monitoring.
   - Neon and Vercel both support autoscaling for production workloads.

## Extensibility

- **Adding AI Models:**
  - Extend the AI provider integration layer to add new models.
- **Custom Tools:**
  - Add new tools via the tool integration framework; configure permissions per agent/organization.
- **UI Components:**
  - Build new features using shadcn/ui for consistency.

## Security

- Each organization's data is fully isolated at the database level.
- Environment variables and API tokens are encrypted and managed securely.
- All user actions are authenticated and scoped to their organization.
