# Context Functionality for Agents

**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Enhanced context management allowing agents to maintain and utilize rich contextual information across conversations.

## Requirements

- **Context Types**: Support multiple context types (documents, data, conversations)
- **Context Upload**: File upload and text input for context data
- **Context Management**: Organize, edit, and delete context items
- **Context Search**: Semantic search within agent context
- **Context Sharing**: Share context between agents within an organization
- **Context Versioning**: Track changes and versions of context data

## Technical Implementation

- Enhanced memory management system
- File upload and processing pipeline
- Context indexing and search
- Version control for context data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Context upload and management interface
- [ ] Multiple context type support
- [ ] Semantic search within context
- [ ] Context sharing between agents

## Notes

- Builds upon existing memory search functionality
- Important for creating specialized agents with domain knowledge
- Consider file size limits and storage costs
- Integration with pgvector for semantic search
