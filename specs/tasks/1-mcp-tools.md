# MCP Tools Integration

**Status**: In Development
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies**: None

## Description

Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools integration to provide organizations with containerized, isolated environments for installing and managing custom MCP tools.

## Requirements

- **Docker Container per Organization**: Each organization gets a dedicated Docker container for MCP tools
- **MCP Installation Interface**: Web UI for installing and managing MCP tools within the organization's container
- **External MCP Connection**: Option to connect to external MCP services running outside the organization's container
- **Tool Discovery**: Automatic discovery and registration of available MCP tools
- **Security Isolation**: Ensure complete isolation between organizations' MCP environments

## Technical Implementation

- Container orchestration using Docker Swarm
- MCP resource monitoring and management API
- Web interface for MCP installation and configuration
- Integration with existing agent tool system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Organizations can create isolated MCP containers
- [ ] Web interface for MCP tool installation
- [ ] External MCP service connection capability
- [ ] MCP tools appear in agent configuration
- [ ] Proper security isolation between organizations

## Notes

- This task is currently in development
- Critical for providing extensible tool capabilities to organizations
- Must maintain strict security isolation between tenants
