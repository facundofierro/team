### Service Architecture

The nginx reverse proxy routes requests to different backend services:

- **TeamHub App** (`teamhub:3000`) - Main Next.js application
- **Nextcloud** (`nextcloud:80`) - File storage and collaboration platform
- **Remotion** (`remotion:3001`) - Video rendering service
- **PostgreSQL** - Database for TeamHub and Nextcloud (internal)
- **Redis** - Cache layer for TeamHub (internal)

### Route Parameters

Most routes accept query parameters for organization-scoped functionality:

- **`organizationId`** (required) - Identifies the active organization
- **`id`** (optional) - For selecting specific agents or data items
- **`tab`** (optional) - For tab-based navigation within pages
- **`tableId`** (optional) - For selecting specific data tables in insights

### Example URLs

```
# Main TeamHub Application
https://r1.teamxagents.com/
https://r1.teamxagents.com/agents?organizationId=org-123
https://r1.teamxagents.com/agents?organizationId=org-123&id=agent-456&tab=config
https://r1.teamxagents.com/insights?organizationId=org-123&tableId=1
https://r1.teamxagents.com/settings?organizationId=org-123

# Additional Services
https://r1.teamxagents.com/nextcloud/          # Nextcloud file storage
https://r1.teamxagents.com/remotion/           # Remotion video rendering
https://r1.teamxagents.com/health              # Health check endpoint
```

### Authentication Flow

1. All routes except `/api/auth/*` require authentication
2. Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to `/api/auth/signin`
3. After successful authentication, users are redirected to the requested page
4. Session management is handled by NextAuth.js with secure cookies

# AI Gateway

## Overview

AI Gateway is a universal, extensible API service designed to provide a unified interface for connecting to multiple AI providers and services. It supports a wide range of modalities (text, image, audio, multimodal) and tasks (generation, embedding, classification, detection, training, etc.), making it easy to integrate advanced AI capabilities into your applications.

## Design & Architecture

- **Modular Endpoint Structure:**

  - Endpoints are organized by modality and task: `/api/{modality}/{task}` (e.g., `/api/text/generate`, `/api/image/detect`).
  - This structure allows for easy expansion as new AI tasks and modalities emerge.

- **Provider Abstraction:**

  - Each endpoint accepts a `provider` parameter, allowing dynamic routing to the desired AI service.
  - Providers can be direct (e.g., OpenAI, Deepseek, Fal) or meta-APIs (e.g., EdenAI) that aggregate multiple services.
  - The project is designed to allow per-provider decisions: for each task, you can choose to connect directly or via a meta-API, depending on your needs and available keys.

- **Security:**

  - All endpoints are protected with API key authentication for secure server-to-server communication.

- **Extensibility:**
  - The folder structure supports future tasks such as training, detection, segmentation, OCR, and more for each modality.
  - Adding a new provider or task is as simple as creating a new handler in the appropriate folder and updating the provider abstraction.

## Example Folder Structure

```
src/app/api/
  text/
    generate/
    embed/
    train/
  image/
    generate/
    classify/
    detect/
    segment/
    ocr/
    train/
  audio/
    generate/
    transcribe/
    train/
  multimodal/
    generate/
    train/
```

## Supported Providers

- **Direct:** OpenAI, Deepseek, Fal (with API keys)
- **Meta-API:** EdenAI (for rapid access to many providers and tasks)
- Additional providers can be added as needed.

## How to Add a New Provider or Task

1. Create a new folder under the appropriate modality/task.
2. Implement the route handler, using the provider abstraction pattern.
3. Add your API key(s) to the environment.
4. Update documentation as needed.

## Why This Design?

- **Scalable:** Easily add new AI capabilities as the field evolves.
- **Flexible:** Choose the best provider for each task, or use meta-APIs for breadth.
- **Maintainable:** Clear separation of concerns and easy-to-navigate codebase.
