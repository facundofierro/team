### Service Architecture

The nginx reverse proxy routes requests to different backend services:

- **TeamHub App** (`teamhub:3000`) - Main Next.js application
- **Nextcloud** (`nextcloud:80`) - File storage and collaboration platform
- **Remotion** (`remotion:3001`) - Video rendering service
- **PostgreSQL** - Database for TeamHub and Nextcloud (internal)
- **Redis** - Cache layer for TeamHub (internal)

### Route Parameters

Most routes accept query parameters for organization-scoped functionality:

- **`organizationId`** (required) - Identifies the active organization
- **`id`** (optional) - For selecting specific agents or data items
- **`tab`** (optional) - For tab-based navigation within pages
- **`tableId`** (optional) - For selecting specific data tables in insights

### Example URLs

```
# Main TeamHub Application
https://r1.teamxagents.com/
https://r1.teamxagents.com/agents?organizationId=org-123
https://r1.teamxagents.com/agents?organizationId=org-123&id=agent-456&tab=config
https://r1.teamxagents.com/insights?organizationId=org-123&tableId=1
https://r1.teamxagents.com/settings?organizationId=org-123

# Additional Services

https://r1.teamxagents.com/remotion/           # Remotion video rendering
https://r1.teamxagents.com/health              # Health check endpoint
```

### Authentication Flow

1. All routes except `/api/auth/*` require authentication
2. Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to `/api/auth/signin`
3. After successful authentication, users are redirected to the requested page
4. Session management is handled by NextAuth.js with secure cookies
