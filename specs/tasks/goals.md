## 🔧 Technical Architecture Decisions

### n8n Integration Strategy

**Why n8n Instead of Custom Workflow Engine**:

1. **Time to Market**: 6-12 months faster deployment
2. **Maturity**: n8n has 5+ years of development and testing
3. **Community**: Large ecosystem of workflows and integrations
4. **Focus**: Concentrate on AI agents and MCP integration
5. **Customer Value**: Provide both AI agents and proven workflow automation

**Integration Architecture**:

```
TeamHub AI Agents ←→ API Gateway ←→ n8n Workflows
       ↓                    ↓              ↓
   Memory &        Data Transformation  External
Conversation      & Orchestration      Systems
```

**Benefits of This Approach**:

- **Faster Development**: Leverage existing n8n capabilities
- **Better Workflows**: n8n has superior workflow design tools
- **More Integrations**: Access to 200+ n8n integrations
- **Reduced Risk**: Proven technology vs. custom development
- **Customer Choice**: Customers can use n8n independently if needed

### MCP Protocol Status
